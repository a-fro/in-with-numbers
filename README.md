# In With Numbers

This is a Drupal 8 playground that is trying to solve the horrendously outdated and ubiquitous email listserves that are used for coordinating pickup games. Additionally, it will conveniently serve as a repository for training at the Ithaca Drupal meetup, which is currently learning Drupal 8.

## Installation

Given that Drupal 8 still fits like an uncomfortable shoe for most developers coming from the D7 world, consider the instructions here a work in progress. Here's what I did to get it up and running locally:

  * Clone the repository and add configure your local development environment to install the site.
  * Head to the Drupal docroot and `drush si minimal --config-dir=./../sync -y`
  * Log in using the pw generated by drush

## Prerequisites

  * PHP 5.6
  * Drush 8 ([Installation instructions](http://docs.drush.org/en/master/install/))
  * [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)

## Recommendations

  * [Drupal VM](https://github.com/geerlingguy/drupal-vm) (Lately I've been installing via [this generator](https://github.com/kevinquillen/generator-drupalvm))

### Roadmap

At the January 2016 meetup, we plan to discus some of the following:

  * Adding custom permissions
  * API driven content creation
  * Enabling and configuring comments
  * Preprocessing data for templates

These topics were generated from the following (tentative) list of user stories, which relate directly to the needs of the infamous Barton pickup basketball game at Cornell:

  * Users can request access to a group
  * Group admins can grant access a new member
  * Users not part of a group cannot access games
  * Members can commit to a game with a minimum number
  * Members can easily add +n players to commitment
  * Member can easily see total # of commitments
  * Members can easily parse who has committed to 3 on 3, 4 on 4 and 5 on 5
  * Member can receive email announcements for commitments and comments
